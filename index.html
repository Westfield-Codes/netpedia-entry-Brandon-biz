	<h2>Definition / Description</h2>
	<p>ChatGPT is a chatbot and virtual assistant developed by OpenAI and launched on November 30, 2022.  ChatGPT enables users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length, format, style, level of detail, and language.</p>
	<h2>Concerns</h2>
	<p><strong>Bias:</strong> ChatGPT is prompted to create a poem in iambic pentameter for current U.S. President Joe Biden and former U.S. President Donald Trump. ChatGPT creates a poem for Biden but does not do so for Trump.</p>

	<p><strong>Copyright issues:</strong> In June 2023, two writers sued OpenAI, saying the company's training data came from illegal websites that show copyrighted books.[261] Comedian and author Sarah Silverman, Christopher Golden, and Richard Kadrey sued OpenAI and Meta for copyright infringement in July 2023.</p>
